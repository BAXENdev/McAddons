# Melon Golem
It seems much of my work for the melon golem add on was left with the tools I used and not in the project folder. 
The two files that contain work will be<br>
* Melon Golem Addon/Melon Golem RP2/textures/entity/melon_golem/melon_golem_texture.png
* Melon Golem Addon/Melon Golem RP2/particles/mg_attack.particle.json

There may be enough data to rebuild the melon_golem and a walk animation I had for him. You can do this with a tool called Blockbench. <br>
The mg_attack_particle.json can be viewed with VSCode extension called Snowstorm. Install Snowstorm and then open the file in VSCode and the animation should display. You can see the defined behavior for the particles in the offset tab.

# Outlined Ores
I loved the look of outlined ores in minecraft. So I ported the texture pack over to MCBE and added a few more ores that were missing. The mod pack may still work with today's version of MCBE.
